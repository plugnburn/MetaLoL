# Metaprog

MetaLOL - Created by the community for the lulz and ะช fun

## About

MetaLOL (or AMP, _AntiMetaProg_) is a community effort to create a multi-paradigm visual programming environment which would be a viable Metaprog alternative created using modern technologies and techniques.

Core MetaLOL/AMP principles shall be:

- **Simplicity** - the code must be readable even for complicated software;
- **Stability** - generated code must be prone to low-level errors despite its complexity;
- **Extensibility** - one should be able to extend the language and environment with no limits once the core functionality is in place. Including any system library bindings.

## Concept ideas (subject to change)

1. [Red](https://www.red-lang.org/) as the backend language. _Rationale_: cross-platform, homoiconicity, simplified code generation, powerful GUI APIs, compact compiler, lots of "batteries" included.
2. [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) as the code diagram plotting engine. _Rationale_: cross-platform, declarative, consistent representation of links and nodes.
3. Low number of different graph node types - as of now, just 8 of them are planned: module declaration, block declaration, function declaration, literal node, call node, event node, object node. _Rationale_: everything else can be extended on top of these basic node types.
